# DPTTR - Data Processing for Tierpsy Tracker Results

This repository contains data processing scripts and results for analyzing motility features of *C. elegans* strains L1, L2, and N2 using timeseries data generated by the Tierpsy Tracker.

## 🧪 Data Processing Overview

The following steps were performed to clean and structure the data for analysis:

1. **Filtered datasets** to include only time series with more than **245 frames** (~10 seconds).
2. **Dropped unnecessary columns** and retained only relevant features.
3. **Imputed missing values (NaNs)** with the **column means**.
4. **Grouped the data** by:
   - `measurement_type`
   - `measurement_class`
   - `body_type`
5. **Reorganized the dataset** into a format that facilitates statistical analysis.

This workflow was inspired and guided by the documentation and methodology from **Arcadia Science**:
- 📘 [Arcadia Software Handbook](https://github.com/Arcadia-Science/arcadia-software-handbook)
- 💻 [2024 Worm Tracking Repository](https://github.com/Arcadia-Science/2024-worm-tracking/tree/main?tab=MIT-1-ov-file)

## 📊 Statistical Analysis

For the statistical analysis, the following metrics were calculated for each strain and feature:

- `estimate`
- `std.error`
- `statistic`
- `df`
- `p.value`
- `p_adj_bonferroni`
- `is_significant_adj`

> ⚠️ *Note:* The Bonferroni correction method applied here may be overly conservative or inaccurate from our perspective. Further analysis is ongoing and results will be updated accordingly.

## 📈 Visualization

Using the cleaned dataset, we generated several plots to compare motility features across strains, including:

- `'curvature_midbody_mean'`
- `'relative_to_hips_angular_velocity_tail_tip_mean'`
- `'curvature_std_neck_mean'`
- `'relative_to_neck_angular_velocity_head_tip_mean'`
- `'motion_mode_mean'`
- `'speed_mean'`

### Heatmaps:
- **Heatmap of Motility Features by Strain** (Samples vs. Parameters)
- **Correlation Heatmap Between Parameters**

---

## 📌 Summary

Finally, the **mean values per strain and motility parameter** were computed for further interpretation and biological insight.
